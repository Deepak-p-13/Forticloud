In response to escalating concerns regarding data privacy and security within
traditional public cloud services, a pioneering solution emerges in the form of a private cloud
platform. Unlike conventional private cloud offerings reliant on third-party managed remote
storage, our solution provides users with a tangible storage unit integrated with a Raspberry Pi,
affording unparalleled control and security. Central to our approach is the empowerment of
users to own and manage their cloud infrastructure, thereby ensuring data sovereignty and
reducing dependency on distant data centers. A robust hashing mechanism forms the
cornerstone of our security architecture, safeguarding user authentication through hashed
credentials stored on both the device server and client-side application, supplemented by
randomized hashes upon user logout. Furthermore, our platform facilitates seamless global

data access, leveraging the Raspberry Pi OS for user-friendly interaction or advanced terminal-
based operations. Through this innovative endeavor, we aspire to furnish users with a secure,

flexible, and user-centric alternative to conventional cloud services, thereby enabling them to
assert control over their data while upholding privacy and security standards.
